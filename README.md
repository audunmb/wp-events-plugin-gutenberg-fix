# wp-events-plugin-gutenberg-fix
Fixes the issue in [Events Manager for Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/events-manager/) where Event Categories and Tags won't show if you use the block editor (Gutenberg) to edit events instead of the classic editor. 

To install, simply download the files as a ZIP and install the zip-file as a plugin in Wordpress. You obviously need the Events Manager for Wordpress-plugin as well.
